# About the human behind the screen
My name's HÃ©ctor. I'm a spaniard in his 20s, a former philosophy student and, at the moment, a tentative explorer of adulthood.


I am currently undertaking an experimental depth year (see this link for [the original proposal and explanation of what a depth year is](https://www.raptitude.com/2017/12/go-deeper-not-wider/). My goals for it are:

- Deepen my knowledge of existing hobbies and work actively on them.
- Deepen my roots in communities I'm already a part of.
- Be more compassionate with myself through letting myself like harmless things without judgement.
  

I will be documenting the journey on the entries listed below, as well as other random longform thoughts.
