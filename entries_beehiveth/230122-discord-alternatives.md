title: Depth year - Discord and its alternatives
---

I feel like I am succeeding in the social aspect of my depth year (at least in my online relations); I am trying to be comfortable in topics of conversation beyond League and not struggling as much as I expected. There's still something that feels off about the process (beyond not being as dilligent in my real life relations) and I think the fact that I am on a platform with heavy telemetry, far from self administered and for which I have to shill 120â‚¬ a year for full functionality pisses me off. Oh, Discord, you absolute binch.


I have looked into alternatives, about what makes Discord good and where else to find it. Active? None. Voice chat and text chat? Just the Element client for Matrix, which is a bit hellish and (perhaps more importantly) I would also have to pay for upkeep of an instance with like, half the benefits Discord has as a mainstream app. Accessible and customizable? Revolt, which can't be self-hosted just yet, not that I'd know how.


So, as it is, I have these choices to make:


1. Give requirements up.
- I could give voice chat up.
- I could look for less customizable software.
- I could look for paid hosting, though cheaper than Nitro.


2. Learn how to be at peace with Discord.
- Save enough yearly for Nitro.
- Let go of my privacy concerns, I suppose?
- Make my spaces as accessible and personal as possible.

For now, I will think about software that is pleasant to use, and I will include Discord in the list to evaluate it fairly against other options. Features-wise, it would probably win, but is it worth the persistent unease? Eh.
