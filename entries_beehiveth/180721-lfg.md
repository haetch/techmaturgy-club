## About
I'm Bee, a Spanish guy in his mid-20s. I've been playing League since season 7. I peaked at Gold III in S9, but I stopped playing ranked when my eyesight started worsening due to glaucoma during the 2020 lockdown. 

I'm having to essentially relearn the game as a legally blind player (which is not an easy task!) but I want to keep partaking in one of my favorite hobbies despite these circumstances.

I like to paint and do photography in my spare time (though, again, with some limitations), and I fiddle with low resources tech from time to time.


## Roles
` **Support** (primary):` Lux, Seraphine, Swain, Braum

` **ADC** (secondary):` Caitlyn, Xayah, Jinx, Tristana

` **Mid** (if needed):` Neeko, Lissandra, Pantheon

## Playstyle


> I play for early lane snowballing and focusing on macro once we have a slight advantage. I like splitpushing as an ADC and roaming as a Support, and I like queuing with people who also enjoy map-wide plays.


`pros` I am adaptable. I have big champion pools and know my way around botlane combos, and when I'm confident in the matchup or my teammates I can shift my playstyle to fit the demands of the game very well.

`cons` I can have trouble playing from behind if we have a rough early, since I don't want to be a burden for the team, and it can make me either overly passive or overly risk blind. A kind teammate can help me bounce back with encouragement.
