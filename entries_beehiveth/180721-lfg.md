## Playstyle

I play for early lane snowballing and focusing on macro once we have a slight advantage. I like splitpushing as an ADC and roaming as a Support, and I like queuing with people who also enjoy map-wide plays.

➕ I am adaptable. I have big champion pools and know my way around botlane combos, and when I'm confident in the matchup or my teammates I can adapt to the demands of the game very well.

➖ I am somewhat risk blind; when I play ADC I sometimes splitpush solo, forgetting how vulnerable I am to ambushes. I can have trouble playing from behind if we have a rough early, since I don't want to be a burden for the team, but kindness helps me clear my head and get back up and running.

➕ I am literally a gay trans dude and physically disabled, so I'm essentially immune to enemy shittalk and thus untiltable.
