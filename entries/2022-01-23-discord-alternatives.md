title: 'Depth year - Discord and its alternatives'
---

I feel like I am succeeding in the social aspect of my depth year (at least in my online relations); I am trying to be comfortable in topics of conversation beyond League and not struggling as much as I expected. There's still something that feels off about the process (beyond not being as dilligent in my real life relations) and I think the fact that I am on a platform with heavy telemetry, far from self administered and for which I have to shill 120â‚¬ a year for full functionality pisses me off. Oh, Discord, you absolute binch.


I have looked into alternatives, about what makes Discord good and where else to find it. Active? None. Voice chat and text chat? Just the Element client for Matrix, which is a bit hellish and (perhaps more importantly) I would also have to pay for upkeep of an instance with like, half the benefits Discord has as a mainstream app. Accessible and customizable? Revolt, which can't be self-hosted just yet, not that I'd know how.


So, as it is, I have these choices to make:


1. Give requirements up.
- I could give voice chat up.
- I could look for less customizable software.
- I could look for paid hosting, though cheaper than Nitro.


2. Learn how to be at peace with Discord.
- Save enough yearly for Nitro.
- Let go of my privacy concerns, I suppose?
- Make my spaces as accessible and personal as possible.

For now, I will think about software that is pleasant to use, and I will include Discord in the list to evaluate it fairly against other options. Features-wise, it would probably win, but is it worth the persistent unease? Eh.

I wrote the first part of this entry sometime this afternoon, and it's now 1 AM. I've been thinking about formats and software while I worked on getting this site set up.

I think voice chat is core to my progress on depth year and future interactions, and the only solid provider for livw VoIP is Discord, plus it certainly is more versatile than my other favorite options (e-mail, pubnixes, scuttlebutt). 


*However*, I have noticed that all of the aforementioned have one element in common: They are primarily longform. I'm not sure if this is a preference because I communicate better in free longform than I do in short bursts (Discord messages, toots on Mastodon) but it might be a sign that I need to incorporate it into my communication more.

For now, Discord stays. I will reevaluate Nitro, though. And I will think about ways to implement two-way communication on this site (comments... IndieWeb has a ton of resources) since I feel it's a wonderful place to dump and organize thoughts.
