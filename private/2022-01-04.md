My life feels oddly structureless right now, as if guided entirely by impulse, which is usually a sign that I need some kind of structure before it all spirals out of control.

I need to make a list of things to tend to and try to build a routine around them that doesn't suck. => What things are making my life feel out of control?

- Skipping appointments
- All my social life is online
- I barely go out
- I keep forgetting my meds
- My living space is messy
- I keep checking social networks for notifications that I know aren't there and wasting a lot of time. hell, i keep checking my blog that *i update myself* for updates???
- My sleep schedule is garbage, with naps and sleepless nights, or no sleep at all
- (right now) I need to shower
- I don't move and it makes me feel stagnant and awful
- I don't change out of my pajamas (for class, or otherwise)
- All my projects are digital and don't help me improve my skills (marketable or not)
- I've stopped learning languages
