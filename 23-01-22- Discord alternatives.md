# FOSS alternatives

## Topic
I believe in the motivating principles of libre software as directly democratic, public service that has the potential to be accessible in every sense of the word. Most of its implementations, though, are a factual hellscape to navigate, learn, implement... From my mildly tech-knowledgeable user point of view. Here are some musings that involve this topic.

### Depth year: Is Discord the best medium? (23 Jan 2022)
I feel like I am succeeding in the social aspect of my depth year (at least in my online relations); I am trying to be comfortable in topics of conversation beyond League and not struggling as much as I expected. There's still something that feels off about the process (beyond not being as dilligent in my real life relations) and I think the fact that I am on a platform with heavy telemetry, far from self administered and for which I have to shill 120â‚¬ a year for full functionality pisses me off. Oh, Discord, you absolute binch.
I have looked into alternatives, about what makes Discord good and where else to find it. Active? None. Voice chat and text chat? Just the Element client for Matrix, which is a bit hellish and (perhaps more importantly) I would also have to pay for upkeep of an instance with like, half the benefits Discord has as a mainstream app. Accessible and customizable? Revolt, which can't be self-hosted just yet, not that I'd know how.


So, as it is, I have these choices to make:


1. Give requirements up.
- I could give voice chat up.
- I could look for less customizable software.
- I could look for paid hosting, though cheaper than Nitro.


2. Learn how to be at peace with Discord.
- Save enough yearly for Nitro.
- Let go of my privacy concerns, I suppose?
- Make my spaces as accessible and personal as possible.

For now, I will think about software that is pleasant to use, and I will include Discord in the list to evaluate it fairly against other options. Features-wise, it would probably win, but is it worth the persistent unease? Eh.
