The staff is a mobility aid, but the in-game design fucing sucks = Integrating the hexcore into a functional crutch?

The legs have pistons and the joints in the upper limbs of the in-game model look mechanical. = Either prosthetic (arms yes, maybe legs) or orthetics (leg support). = What conditions and context could lead to those bodymods?

I think the amputation might have either been an experiment to see if a previous damage could be fixed, if self-performing surgery was possible, OR a consequence of body dysmorphia and an untreated mood disorder. I don't think the experimentation suits my interpretation of his leitmotifs, but a mixture of "I am dissociating, my body and perception of pain feels very weird and distant and *fuck* I've been thinking and planning this for literal years. Time to self administer local anaesthesia and casually saw a hand off." He survives. He doesn't get sepsis, I don't know how. Probably research, skill.

Regarding the diagnosis: I think he might have cerebral palsy. Probably spastic diplegia, because the gait in the model feels familiar (hip and knee muscle lock, angled inversion of the feet? And probably some back issues too, maybe because of the leg mobility issues being long-term -- I think the shoulder and chest look like braces and locks as well.)

Orthotics: Hip-knee-ankle: Staple since childhood; probably makeshift before Piltover Academy, probably even until Techmaturgy. I suspect Piltover wasn't the most keen on providing mobility aids for anyone lol fuck Piltover

Telescopic cane (can be adjusted for height). It's probably the closest to the in-game staff design while being functional, but also I feel like it's not enough to support anything beyond monoplegic CP. == Ideally a wheelchair. Motorized later on because it feels like a really fun pet project, and like a step towards a full exoskeletal armor with muscle support and motorized mobility. But foldable wheelchair sounds reasonable and I don't think beyond the consequences of the diplegia the upper body is affected. Buff arms in prototype Viktor but his legs are either literal wooden stick prosthetics or probably muscular dystrophy.

Prosthetics: I'm pretty sure that initial amputation, coupled with literal biotech studies, plus Glorious Evolution understood as technological enhancements to a biological sustrate leads to back-alley surgeon praxis. I think he would provide free augmentation (bodymod, hormones, implants, substitutions and the technical maintenance) for other Zaunites with disabilities. => NGL I do see him literally shoving an ice pick up his nose to "remove his emotions" because Borderline or Bipolar, in manic moments, are overwhelming in the intensity of them and I do sometimes want to extirpate that part of my brain. This is fiction! DIY LOBOTOMY, BITCH. But I feel like as a consequence, or maybe leading to that, there's a disregard, a fear of the mind and its ailments, that leads to a full focus on body mechanics and not at all on mental health. This lasts until his mid-30s, probably until he starts actually working with Naph and other children of Zaun and he observes developmental variation and is more mindful about the consequences of badly managed issues.

I wonder if I should write about this because I'm at a point where I would not trust anyone without any kind of experience with an actual disabled person to not treat incontinence and bowel/bladder issues like either voyeuristic kink, inspirational bullshit, infantilizing crap or scatological humor but here we are.

The thought of interaction of Viktor (or any disabled Zaunite) with any Piltovian instills so much fear in me, I swear to god. But the condescension, especially from Jayce is so fucking tangible. I do want to think about where it would lead considering a relationship during Academy years, because I would like to think that even if he's either like "hee hee piss", "catheters are gross", or "what do you mean you wear a diaper? but you're so smart!" he would be less of a dipshit, but who knows, it's Jayce Giopara. In any case, I do like to think it leads to an interest in the social aspect of tech, just always from a very distant perspective where one does not want to get their hands dirty with the consequences of elitism, gatekeeping of higher education (or any education at all, really), prohibitive prices of medical assistance and just generally getting slapped in the face with the fallibility of humanity, and by humanity we mean *you*, poster boy of progress. I'm sure as Jayce understands what obliviousness does to Zaun, his discomfort just leads to turning a blind eye to it, and Viktor goes from innocently in love but pissed off to full class consciousness and revolutionary, bioterrorist (in a good way) mindset. It's hard coming to the realisation that your crush is actually a sheltered pissbaby that can't look you in the eye when you tell him you need antibiotics for an urinary tract infection. Little bitch.
