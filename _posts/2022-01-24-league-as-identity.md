> Content warnings: `Internalized ableism`

This past week or so I've come to somehow, miraculously, find the thought of playing League entirely panic-inducing. 

Theoretically, I'm still into it, and I'll look for people to play with both within my trusted circles and in public LFG spaces, but the moment I'm in lobby, all queued up and ready to go, I'll be filled with dread and end up force shutting down my computer and going somewhere quiet until the nausea passes.

I think there's an important burnout component: I've been intensely into this game for four years straight and these past few months I played two or three games religiously each day, and the moment I've let myself take a break, the League-free time seems more valuable, if unfamiliar and a bit unsettling. But I think that what is truly undeniable is that my own sense of grief and loss regarding my vision is inextricably tied to the burnout and making these brushes with the game unpleasant rather than indifferent.

I've left a trail of emotional messages in various social media in my moments of vulnerability where I place a lot of value in my ability to perform adequately in League and seeing myself lose my edge is tearing down a lot of my self image. Not because I'm rusty (I practice religiously every day, after all), but because the game is entirely inaccessible to someone with low vision. I *know* not being able to partake in certain activities was an inevitable consequence of my worsening eyesight, but why does losing League of Legends hurt so much? I can only theorise. 

- Most of my closest friends, both online and off, play, and it's such a big part of my life that it became a big part of these relationships by proxy.
- It was a source of comfort and purpose back when I left University trying to leave severe trauma behind. It has never stopped anchoring me in moments where reality seemed too vague, the lack of predefined steps and perfect decisions painful.
- It was persistent proof that regular practice, interest and investing time into a project would yield visible results and bring me satisfaction.
- Its lore, art and creative content is a constant source of inspirationfor all my personal artistic endeavors, and brings me a lot of joy.

Here are some truths: I am scared of being lost and overwhelmed by choice. I am scared of not having something so specific as an all-encompassing tag for myself. I am scared of finding out that my friends and I have nothing in common beyond this videogame, that I am boring, that I lack depth. I am scared of becoming a featureless cripple whose defining characteristic is their disability.

I always put too much stock in my fandoms, anyway. And never enough in my actual life and personal development.

Who am I? Now that I don't have a multibillion dollar game to hide behind, what is there of me?
