    <h1>About the human behind the screen</h1>
    <p>My name's HÃ©ctor. I'm a spaniard in his 20s, a former philosophy student and, at the moment, a tentative explorer of adulthood.</p>
    <p>I am currently undertaking an experimental depth year (see this link for <a href="https://www.raptitude.com/2017/12/go-deeper-not-wider/">the original proposal and explanation of what a depth year is</a>). My goals for it are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Deepen my knowledge of existing hobbies and work actively on them.</li>
        <li>Deepen my roots in communities I'm already a part of.</li>
        <li>Be more compassionate with myself through letting myself like harmless things without judgement.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I will be documenting the journey on the entries listed below, as well as other random longform thoughts.</p>
